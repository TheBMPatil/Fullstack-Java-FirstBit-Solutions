          <h5>Web Development</h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing
            a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a
            private network). This can include web design, web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web
            server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
            development. However, among web professionals, "web development"
            usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites:
            writing markup and coding. Web development can range from developing
            the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex
            web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or social
            network services.
          </p>

          <h5>Web development as an industry</h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Since the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest
            growing industries in the world. In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000
            web development companies in the United States, but by 2005 there
            were over 30,000 such companies[citation needed] in the U.S. alone.
            The growth of this industry is being pushed by large businesses
            wishing to sell products and services to their customers and to
            automate business workflow.
          </p>
          <h5>Security Considerations</h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Web development takes into account many security considerations,
            such as data entry error checking through forms, filtering output,
            and encryption.[1] Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be
            executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge
            of web development as a whole. Scripts can be exploited to grant
            unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect information
            such as email addresses, passwords and protected content like credit
            card numbers.
